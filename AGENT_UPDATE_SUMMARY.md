# 🚀 Intelligent Agent - Real Implementation Update

## Summary

The Intelligent Agent has been upgraded from a **mock/simulation** to a **real, working implementation** that actually builds software using Claude Code, Spec-Kit, and ShinkaEvolve.

## What Was Changed

### ❌ Before (The Problem)
- Agent only **simulated** responses with placeholder messages
- No actual code generation or file creation
- Mock `executeClaude()` method that just printed "✅ Done!"
- No real integration with tools
- User complained: "instead of actually building any software... it keeps repeating itself"

### ✅ After (The Solution)
- Agent **actually executes** real tools
- Real code generation and file creation
- Task list management system
- Parallel and sequential task execution
- Real integration with Claude Code, Spec-Kit, and ShinkaEvolve

## New Features

### 1. **Task Management System** (`src/agent/task-manager.ts`)

Complete task tracking with:
- ✅ Add tasks with descriptions, priorities, types, and dependencies
- ✅ Track task status (pending → in_progress → completed/failed)
- ✅ Display task lists with progress indicators
- ✅ Get executable tasks (respecting dependencies)
- ✅ Parallel task execution support
- ✅ Event-based notifications (task added, started, completed, failed)

**Task Types:**
- `feature` - New feature development
- `bug_fix` - Bug fixes (high priority by default)
- `optimization` - Performance optimization
- `test` - Test coverage improvements
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `general` - General development

**Task Priorities:**
- `high` - Executed first, sequentially
- `medium` - Executed in parallel (batch of 2)
- `low` - Executed in parallel (batch of 3)

### 2. **Task Executor** (`src/agent/task-executor.ts`)

Real tool execution engine:
- ✅ **Execute with Claude Code**: Spawns real Claude CLI with prompts
- ✅ **Execute with Spec-Kit**: Runs /constitution, /specify, /plan, /tasks, /implement
- ✅ **Execute with ShinkaEvolve**: Triggers real evolutionary optimization
- ✅ **Execute with All Tools**: Orchestrated workflow using all three
- ✅ **Auto-tool selection**: Intelligently chooses tools based on task type
- ✅ **Parallel execution**: Runs multiple tasks concurrently
- ✅ **Error handling**: Catches and reports failures

**Tool Selection Logic:**
```
feature (simple)      → Claude Code
feature (complex)     → All tools (Spec-Kit + Claude + Evolution)
bug_fix              → Claude Code
optimization         → ShinkaEvolve
test                 → Claude Code
refactor (simple)    → Claude Code
refactor (complex)   → Claude Code + ShinkaEvolve
```

### 3. **Updated Intelligent Agent** (`src/agent/intelligent-agent.ts`)

Enhanced agent with real execution:
- ✅ Integrates TaskManager and TaskExecutor
- ✅ Creates tasks from user input
- ✅ Asks user if they want to execute immediately or add more tasks
- ✅ Executes tasks with real tools
- ✅ Updates project health metrics based on completed tasks
- ✅ Tracks code quality, test coverage, bug count

**New Commands:**
```bash
tasks              # Show all tasks in the list
add task: <desc>   # Add a task manually
execute            # Execute all pending tasks
clear tasks        # Clear all tasks
help               # Updated help with task management
```

## How It Works

### User Flow

```
User: "add task: Create a calculator function"
      ↓
Agent: Creates task with type=feature, priority=medium, tool=claude
      ↓
Agent: "Execute this task now? (yes/no/add more tasks)"
      ↓
User: "add more tasks"
      ↓
User: "add task: Add tests for calculator"
      ↓
Agent: Creates task with type=test, priority=medium, tool=claude
      ↓
User: "execute"
      ↓
Agent: Executes both tasks using real Claude Code
      ↓
Result: Files created, code generated, tasks marked complete ✅
```

### Execution Flow

```
executeAllPendingTasks()
    ↓
Get executable tasks (no pending dependencies)
    ↓
Group by priority (high, medium, low)
    ↓
Execute high priority sequentially
    ↓
Execute medium priority in parallel (batch of 2)
    ↓
Execute low priority in parallel (batch of 3)
    ↓
Each task execution:
    - Mark as in_progress
    - Call TaskExecutor.executeTask()
    - TaskExecutor selects and runs appropriate tool
    - Mark as completed or failed
    - Update project health metrics
```

### Real Tool Integration

**Claude Code Execution:**
```typescript
// Spawns real Claude CLI with stdin/stdout pipes
spawn('claude', [], {
  cwd: workingDir,
  stdio: ['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe']
})
// Sends prompt via stdin
child.stdin.write(prompt + '\n')
// Captures real output from stdout
```

**Spec-Kit Execution:**
```typescript
// Detects task intent and maps to Spec-Kit command
/constitution → For principles
/specify      → For requirements
/plan         → For architecture
/tasks        → For task breakdown
/implement    → For implementation

// Executes via Claude Code with Spec-Kit commands
```

**ShinkaEvolve Execution:**
```typescript
// Finds code files in project
// Creates evaluation script
// Runs real evolution with:
runEvolution({
  init_program_path: codeFile,
  eval_program_path: evalScript,
  num_generations: 5,
  max_parallel_jobs: 2,
  llm_models: ['azure-gpt-4.1-mini']
})
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Feature
```bash
softautoevolve agent ./my-project

💬 You: add task: Create a function to calculate factorial
✅ Task added: task-1 - Create a function to calculate factorial

💬 You: execute
🚀 Executing: Create a function to calculate factorial
   Tool: claude | Type: feature | Priority: medium
   🤖 Using Claude Code...
[Real Claude Code output appears here...]
✅ Task completed: task-1
```

### Example 2: Multiple Tasks with Priorities
```bash
💬 You: add task: Fix memory leak in data processor
✅ Task added: task-1 (bug_fix, HIGH priority)

💬 You: add task: Add user registration feature
✅ Task added: task-2 (feature, MEDIUM priority)

💬 You: add task: Optimize database queries
✅ Task added: task-3 (optimization, MEDIUM priority)

💬 You: tasks
📋 Task List:
⏸️ task-1: Fix memory leak in data processor
   🔴 HIGH [claude] | Type: bug_fix

⏸️ task-2: Add user registration feature
   🟡 MEDIUM [all] | Type: feature

⏸️ task-3: Optimize database queries
   🟡 MEDIUM [shinka-evolve] | Type: optimization

💬 You: execute
🚀 Executing 3 tasks...

[High priority task runs first (sequentially)]
🚀 Executing: Fix memory leak in data processor
[Real execution happens...]
✅ Task completed: task-1

[Medium priority tasks run in parallel (2 at a time)]
🚀 Executing: Add user registration feature
🚀 Executing: Optimize database queries
[Real parallel execution...]
✅ Task completed: task-2
✅ Task completed: task-3

✅ All tasks executed!
```

### Example 3: Natural Language Flow
```bash
💬 You: I want to build a todo app

🧠 Agent Decision:
   Intent: new_project
   Action: initialize_project
   Priority: medium
   📋 Using Spec-Kit for structure
   💭 Reasoning: Project not initialized - need structured approach

💬 Execute this task now? (yes/no/add more tasks)
   > add more tasks

✅ Task added. You can add more tasks and execute them together.

💬 You: add task: Add drag and drop functionality
💬 You: add task: Add real-time sync
💬 You: execute

[All tasks execute with appropriate tools...]
```
