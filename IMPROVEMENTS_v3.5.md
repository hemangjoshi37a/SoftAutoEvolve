# 🚀 SoftAutoEvolve v3.5 - Sensors & Actuators Edition

## 🎯 Critical Fixes & Conceptual Clarity

**v3.5** fixes the Claude Code hanging issue and introduces proper **Sensors/Actuators** terminology for better conceptual understanding of the closed-loop system.

---

## ✅ What's Fixed in v3.5

### 1. **Critical: Fixed Claude Code Hanging** 🔧

**Problem in v3.4:**
```
┌─ Claude Code Output ─────────────────────────────┐
│ >> Sending prompt: ...
│ ▸ Waiting for Claude Code response...
│ ⚠  Maximum execution time reached, closing...
```
Process would hang and timeout at 120 seconds every time!

**Root Cause:**
- Claude Code wasn't exiting properly
- Waiting for stdin to close indefinitely
- No proper process termination

**Solution in v3.5:**
```typescript
// Send Ctrl+C after 3 seconds to terminate Claude gracefully
setTimeout(() => {
  child.stdin.write('\x03'); // Ctrl+C
  setTimeout(() => {
    child.stdin.end();
  }, 500);
}, 3000);

// Reduced max timeout to 60 seconds (from 120)
// Increased inactivity timeout to 15 seconds (from 10)
// Added proper SIGTERM/SIGKILL handling
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Claude Code exits cleanly after 3 seconds
- ✅ Proper signal handling (SIGTERM → SIGKILL)
- ✅ 60-second maximum timeout (was 120s)
- ✅ 15-second inactivity detection (was 10s)
- ✅ No more hanging processes

### 2. **Sensors vs Actuators Clarity** 📥📤

**Conceptual Improvement**

Before v3.5, everything was called "sensory capabilities" which was confusing. Now we have proper terminology:

**SENSORS (Input - Perceive Environment):**
- 📥 Screen capture (screenshots)
- 📥 Browser content (web pages)
- 📥 OCR text extraction

**ACTUATORS (Output - Change Environment):**
- 📤 Keyboard (typing, key presses)
- 📤 Mouse (clicking, dragging)
- 📤 Window management (focus, move)

**New Display:**
```
🎮 Sensory System Status:
   X11 Display: ✓

   📥 SENSORS (Input - Perceive Environment):
      Screenshot:  ✓
      Browser:     ✓
      OCR:         ✓

   📤 ACTUATORS (Output - Change Environment):
      Keyboard:    ✓
      Mouse:       ✓
      Window Mgmt: ✓

   🤖 Advanced Automation:
      Actiona:     ✓
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clear distinction between input (sensors) and output (actuators)
- ✅ Better conceptual understanding
- ✅ Matches robotics/control theory terminology
- ✅ Easier to explain to users

### 3. **Fixed Capability Detection** 🔍

**xdotool Detection Fixed**

Problem: xdotool was installed but showing as ✗

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Before (broken):
try {
  await execAsync('which xdotool');
  capabilities.keyboard = true;
} catch {}

// After (working):
try {
  const { stdout } = await execAsync('which xdotool 2>/dev/null');
  if (stdout.trim()) {
    capabilities.actuators.keyboard = true;
    capabilities.actuators.mouse = true;
  }
} catch {}
```

**All Checks Fixed:**
- ✅ xdotool (keyboard/mouse)
- ✅ wmctrl (window management)
- ✅ scrot/gnome-screenshot/import (screenshots)
- ✅ Browser tools (chromium, chrome, firefox)
- ✅ tesseract (OCR)
- ✅ Actiona executable

---

### 4. **Installed Missing Dependencies** 📦

```bash
sudo apt install -y xdotool wmctrl
```

**Now Available:**
- ✅ xdotool - Keyboard and mouse automation
- ✅ wmctrl - Window management

---

### 5. **Sensory System Initialization** 🚀

**Added explicit initialization:**

```typescript
// In autonomous agent startup
await this.sensorySystem.initialize();
```

**Benefits:**
- Checks X11 display availability
- Detects browser tools
- Logs detected capabilities
- Prepares system for use

---

## 🧠 Why Sensors/Actuators?

### From Robotics/Control Theory:

**SENSORS** measure the environment:
- Cameras (vision)
- Microphones (audio)
- Thermometers (temperature)
- **Screens** (visual state)
- **OCR** (text recognition)

**ACTUATORS** change the environment:
- Motors (movement)
- Speakers (sound output)
- Heaters (temperature change)
- **Keyboard** (text input)
- **Mouse** (pointer control)

### Applied to Software Development:

**SENSORS (Input):**
- Screen capture → "See" what's on screen
- Browser → "Read" web pages
- OCR → "Extract" text from images

**ACTUATORS (Output):**
- Keyboard → "Type" text
- Mouse → "Click" buttons
- Window → "Focus" applications

**Closed Loop:**
```
Sensors → AI Brain → Actuators → Environment → Sensors
   ↑                                               ↓
   └───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
